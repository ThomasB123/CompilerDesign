# Compiler Design

See `2019-20_compiler_design_summative.pdf` for details

## Instructions to run:

I only import two modules: sys and pydot
if neccessary, install pydot with pip:
pip install pydot

You can run my program in two ways:
1. from the command line, giving the input file as a parameter:

`python parser.py example.txt`

where 'example.txt' is the name of your input file
and 'python' may have to be 'python3.7' depending on your setup

2. directly from an IDE (or from the command line without any additional arguments)
e.g. python parser.py
if you do this, you will be prompted to enter the input file name.


The grammar file that I generate is named 'grammar.txt'

In my grammar, the starting symbol is 'formula'


I decided to draw an Abstract Syntax Tree

The Abstract Syntax Tree is visualised in 'AST.png'
